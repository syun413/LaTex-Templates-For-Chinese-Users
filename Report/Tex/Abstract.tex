    \textbf{This sample file is about the DeFi project Ordinals.}
    The Ordinals protocol applies ordinal theory to the Bitcoin blockchain, 
    endowing the smallest Bitcoin unit, 
    the satoshi, with unique identifiers,
    enabling tracking, transferring, and assigning meaning. 
    This technology allows for inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain, 
    transforming it into a platform for storing digital assets and broadening its application scope. 
    Its main use includes issuing NFTs on Bitcoin, allowing artworks to be stored on the blockchain. 
    Despite Ordinals bringing innovation to Bitcoin, 
    it still faces several developmental limitations.
